Team Flashquest,

Jon and I were reviewing the hard deadlines and feel like we have some concerns to address before moving forward. In the spirit of keeping everything open as a team, we feel that before signing the documentation, we would like to further negotiate our current vesting schedule / equity as a part of Flashquest. Would you guys be available for a meeting sometime today?
