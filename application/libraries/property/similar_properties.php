/*
In this library, a property id will be given. This class will get the relevant categories for the property and will then do a search for the relevant properties that come back!

This class will return an array of property ids. In the listing_base, there will be a section that displays an individual thumbnail for each one. This could just load in the browse/thumbnail and send it a property_id!
