(FIXED) -- Search bar should only say "Search"

(FIXED) -- (I did this and it looked horrible. Lets keep it where it is. I moved the container up so there is more space for links etc ..)

	Wants search bar to be moved to the left of the Office/Industrial button so that there is more space for the listings to be shown

Bump boxes bigger so that they take up more space on the screen

	Not done yet -- lets chat about this

(FIXED) -- Bump Boxes non-transparent of very very little transparency so it's easier to read

(FIXED) -- Font in bump boxes bigger 

(FIXED) -- Make sure Rick Halliday's picture is the same size as the other team members

(FIXED) ---Wants the background of the listings boxes to be non-transparent 

	I'm guessing that this applies to the thumbnails correct?

(FIXED) -- When hovering over the listings thumbnails, wants the background of the one-line description to be non-transparent

(FIXED) -- Wants behind the "General Details" and "Residential Details" etc to be non-transparent behind it so it can be read easier under the listing info
