Notes

1.) Need to add walkscore to the category section
2.) Need to create a geocoding get class -- doesn't have to use general necessarily other than to get specific columns etc
3.) This will specifically create the content for the maps api to use -- this will also be responsible for getting the actual coordinates of the property itself

4.) VCARDS -- We need a way to implement this seamlessly -- a new library to be used 	somewhere?
	-we can put stuff in the tables wherever, but as long as we don't put it in category_type_categories, it will not be hit in inappropriate places

	-need a new management place online to upload vcards -- will have to use an entire custom class for this because it will not work well with our management section thus far
